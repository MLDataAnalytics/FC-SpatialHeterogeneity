This repository contains the official code and scripts used for our study investigating **Spatial Heterogeneity and Subtypes of Functional Connectivity (FC) Development in Youth**. Our work challenges traditional global brain age metrics by introducing a spatially fine-grained approach to understanding brain maturation.

## ‚ú® Overview

While global brain age metrics offer a general understanding of brain development, they often mask critical local variations. Our research addresses this limitation by introducing a **regional brain development (RBD) index**, which provides a spatially fine-grained assessment of functional connectivity (FC) maturation across the cortex.

Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the **Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC)** for discovery and replicating our findings in the **Human Connectome Project Development (HCP-D) cohort**, we:

1.  **Characterized spatial patterns** of FC development across the cortex.
2.  **Identified distinct subtypes** of individuals based on their unique spatial FC development patterns using advanced clustering techniques.
3.  **Demonstrated superior cognitive performance** in subtypes reflecting advanced development along the sensorimotor-association axis.
4.  **Linked these developmental patterns to gene expression profiles** that are significantly enriched for neural differentiation, synaptogenesis, and myelination.

This work underscores the critical importance of spatial heterogeneity in gaining a deeper understanding of neurocognitive development.

The code provided in this repository enables users to:
* Calculate the regional development index.
* Replicate the clustering analysis to identify FC development subtypes.
* Explore the intricate links between FC development patterns, cognitive performance, and gene expression profiles.

## üìÅ Repository Structure & Code Descriptions

This repository is organized into distinct modules, each containing scripts for specific parts of our analysis:

1.  **`regionwise_age_prediction/`**:
    Contains scripts for performing region-wise age prediction based on the functional connectivity (FC) profile of each cortical region. This forms the basis for the regional brain development index.

2.  **`regionwise_fc_dev_subtyping/`**:
    Includes scripts dedicated to computing the Regional Brain Development (RBD) index maps and subsequently performing the clustering analysis to identify developmental subtypes.

3.  **`gene_association_analysis/`**:
    Houses the scripts for conducting association analyses between the derived RBD patterns and relevant gene expression data.

4.  **`replication_hcpd/`**:
    Provides scripts specifically designed for the replication analysis of the RBD patterns and subtypes using the independent Human Connectome Project Development (HCP-D) cohort.
