# FC-SpatialHeterogeneity
Spatial Heterogeneity and Subtypes of Functional Connectivity Development in Youth

This repository contains the code adn scripts used for data analysis in the study [Spatial Heterogeneity and Subtypes of Functional Connectivity Development in Youth](<https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.01.24.634828>).


## Brief description:

1. **regionwise_age_prediction**: scripts for region-wise age prediction based on the functional connectivity (FC) profile of each cortical region.

2. **regionwise_fc_dev_subtyping**: scripts for computing regional brain development (RBD) index maps and subtyping.

3. **gene_association_analysis**: scripts for association analysis between RBD patterns and gene data.

4. **replication_hcpd**: scripts for replication analysis of the RBD patterns obtained.
